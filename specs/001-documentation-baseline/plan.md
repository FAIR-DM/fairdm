# Implementation Plan: FairDM Documentation Baseline

**Branch**: `001-documentation-baseline` | **Date**: 2025-12-30 | **Spec**: specs/001-documentation-baseline/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-documentation-baseline/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Establish a coherent, role-focused documentation baseline for FairDM that:
- Explains the high-level vision, FAIR-first philosophy, and core architecture (with an explicit link to the constitution).
- Makes the four major documentation sections (admin-guide, contributor-guide, developer-guide, contributing) easy to discover and navigate.
- Provides a single, linear Getting Started journey so a new developer can spin up a demo portal, define a simple Sample/Measurement model, register it, and confirm it appears in the UI and via a programmatic access path.

Implementation will build on the existing documentation site powered by the external `fairdm-docs` utility (which wraps Sphinx and `pydata-sphinx-theme`), aligning structure and content with the feature specification and the FairDM constitution.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Documentation tooling in Python (version as defined by the `fairdm-docs` package and project-wide tooling); content itself is language-agnostic.
**Primary Dependencies**: `fairdm-docs` (Sphinx-based tooling and setup utilities), Sphinx, `pydata-sphinx-theme`, existing FairDM documentation sources under `docs/`.
**Storage**: Static files generated by Sphinx (HTML and related assets); no additional runtime storage beyond what the documentation system already uses.
**Testing**: Documentation build must succeed without warnings-as-errors for newly added/modified pages; optional link-checking and doctest-style checks may be enabled in the future but are out of scope for this initial baseline.
**Target Platform**: Static documentation site suitable for hosting on common platforms (e.g., GitHub Pages or equivalent static hosting), accessible from typical desktop and mobile web browsers.
**Project Type**: Documentation-focused enhancement to an existing web framework project.
**Performance Goals**: This feature MUST NOT introduce obviously heavy assets (for example, large unoptimised images or blocking third-party scripts) and SHOULD keep generated pages broadly comparable in load time to the current documentation baseline; no numeric performance SLOs are defined for this iteration.
**Constraints**: The specification must remain implementation-agnostic; concrete tooling details (e.g., exact CLI commands) belong in developer-oriented quickstarts, not in the feature specification. Content must align with the FairDM constitution and existing high-level docs.
**Scale/Scope**: Initial focus is on the main landing page, admin-guide, contributor-guide, developer-guide, contributing guide, and a single Getting Started journey; future expansions (e.g., more how-to guides) are out of scope for this feature.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

This feature is fully aligned with the FairDM constitution:

- **FAIR-First Research Portals**: Clear, role-focused documentation and a robust Getting Started journey directly support FAIR adoption by helping developers, administrators, and contributors understand how to configure portals and capture FAIR-compliant metadata.
- **Domain-Driven, Declarative Modeling**: The documentation will emphasise the core data model and the registry-based configuration approach, encouraging declarative modeling rather than ad-hoc structures.
- **Configuration Over Custom Plumbing**: The docs will highlight the registry, configuration options, and provided tooling instead of encouraging users to fork or copy core code.
- **Opinionated, Production-Grade Defaults**: Documentation will present the recommended stack (including `fairdm-docs` and the Sphinx/`pydata-sphinx-theme` combination) as the default path, while avoiding hard-coding it into the feature specification.
- **Quality, Sustainability, and Community**: Up-to-date, structured documentation is explicitly called out in the constitution as a requirement for sustainable, community-friendly development.

No constitutional violations or exceptions are anticipated for this feature, so the Complexity Tracking table remains empty.

  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

tests/
└── (No new tests required specifically for this feature; existing project test infrastructure remains unchanged.)
```

**Structure Decision**: This feature operates entirely within the existing `docs/` tree, restructuring and extending content in the main index and the four role-focused sections (admin-guide, contributor-guide, developer-guide, contributing). No new application source packages are introduced. The external `fairdm-docs` package provides the Sphinx/`pydata-sphinx-theme` tooling but does not change this repository’s code layout.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
