# Portal Administration

**For portal administrators** who manage an existing FairDM portal.

```{tip}
This guide focuses on day-to-day administrative tasks in a FairDM portal. For technical setup and deployment, see the [Developer Guide](../portal-development/index.md).
```

## Your Role

As a portal administrator, you are responsible for:

- **Managing users and permissions**: Controlling who can access and edit data in your portal
- **Ensuring data quality**: Reviewing and maintaining FAIR-compliant metadata
- **Overseeing core entities**: Managing Projects, Datasets, Samples, Measurements, Contributors, and Organizations
- **Configuring portal settings**: Customizing your portal to meet your research community's needs
- **Monitoring portal activity**: Tracking usage and ensuring smooth operations

## Core Entities

FairDM organizes research data into four primary levels:

- **Projects**: Collections of related datasets grouped by research topic or theme
- **Datasets**: Collections of samples and measurements related to a specific research domain or hypothesis
- **Samples**: Physical or digital objects that are collected, processed, and analyzed (e.g., rock specimens, water samples, digital artifacts)
- **Measurements**: Quantifiable observations or analyses performed on samples (e.g., chemical composition, physical properties)

Additionally:

- **Contributors**: Individuals and organizations involved in data collection, processing, and publication
- **Organizations**: Research institutions, universities, and other entities affiliated with the portal

```{seealso}
For a detailed technical description of the core data model, see the [Core Data Model documentation](../contributing/core_data_model.md).
