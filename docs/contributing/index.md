# How to Contribute

**For framework contributors** who want to contribute to the core FairDM framework.

```{important}
This guide is for developers who want to contribute to the FairDM framework itself. If you're looking to build a FairDM-powered portal for your research community, please see the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide/index.md). If you want to contribute data to an existing portal, see the [User Guide](../user-guide/index.md).
```

## Your Role

As a framework contributor, you will:

- **Extend the core framework**: Add new features, fix bugs, and improve existing functionality
- **Maintain code quality**: Follow testing, typing, and documentation standards
- **Align with the constitution**: Ensure changes respect FairDM's core principles and architecture
- **Collaborate with the community**: Work with other contributors through issues, discussions, and pull requests

## What You'll Find Here

This guide covers:

- Setting up a FairDM development environment
- Understanding the framework architecture and design philosophy
- Running tests, type checking, linting, and building documentation
- Following the contribution workflow and aligning with the [FairDM constitution](https://github.com/FAIR-DM/fairdm/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md)

Before getting started, please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
