# Framework Contributors

**For FairDM framework contributors** who want to contribute to the core framework itself.

```{important}
**Framework contributors vs portal contributors**: This guide is for people who want to contribute to the FairDM framework codebase, documentation, or examples. If you're looking to:
- **Build a portal** for your research community → see the [Developer Guide](../developer-guide/index.md)
- **Add data** to an existing portal → see the [Contributor Guide](../contributor-guide/index.md) for portal contributors
```

## Your Role

As a framework contributor, you will:

- **Extend the core framework**: Add new features, fix bugs, and improve existing functionality
- **Maintain code quality**: Follow testing, typing, and documentation standards
- **Align with the constitution**: Ensure changes respect FairDM's core principles and architecture
- **Collaborate with the community**: Work with other contributors through issues, discussions, and pull requests

## What You'll Find Here

This guide covers:

- Setting up a FairDM development environment
- Understanding the framework architecture and design philosophy
- Running tests, type checking, linting, and building documentation
- Following the contribution workflow and aligning with the [FairDM constitution](https://github.com/FAIR-DM/fairdm/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md)

Before getting started, please review the [FairDM Constitution](https://github.com/FAIR-DM/fairdm/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md) and respect community standards.
