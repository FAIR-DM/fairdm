# Before you begin

Before diving in, it‚Äôs helpful to be comfortable with the following tools and concepts:

## Assumed knowledge

FairDM is built on top of Python and the Django web framework, so a basic understanding of these technologies is extremely helpful. While you don‚Äôt need to be an expert, familiarity with the following concepts will make your experience smoother:

    - Python programming (especially object-oriented programming)
    - Package management (preferrably using the `Poetry` package)
    - Git version control (basic commands like `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`)
    - Docker (what is it and what problems does it solve?)

```{note}
We highly suggest that you complete the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/tutorial01/) if you are new to Django. It will provide a solid foundation for working within the FairDM framework.
```

## Tools & Technologies

To get started, make sure the following tools are installed on your system.

### üêç Python 3.10 or newer

You‚Äôll also need to install the following globally:

- **Poetry** ‚Äì for dependency management and virtual environments
- **Cookiecutter** ‚Äì for scaffolding a new project from the template

Install with `pip`:

```bash
    pip install poetry cookiecutter
```

### üîß Git

If Git isn‚Äôt already installed, search online for "install Git" followed by your operating system (e.g., "install Git on macOS" or "install Git on Windows").

> üí° Tip: Configure your Git user info with `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`.

## Recommended tools

### üßë‚Äçüíª Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

We highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your IDE of choice. It provides:

- Excellent Python support
- Integrated terminal and Git support
- A rich ecosystem of extensions
- Intuitive UI for managing containers and databases

> ‚úÖ The FairDM project template includes a pre-configured VS Code workspace (`.code-workspace`) that automatically sets up recommended extensions and settings, so you can get started faster.


### üê≥ Docker

Docker is not required to test and develop your FairDM on your local machine. However, when the time comes to deploy your portal to a production setting, it is handy to have Docker installed locally in order to test your deployment settings before pushing it to the cloud.
