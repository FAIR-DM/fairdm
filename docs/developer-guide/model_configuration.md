# Model configuration

As they mature, Django apps can become complex and require some effort to maintain. In order to prevent this complexity overwhelming the developer, FairDM provides a configuration system that allows you to register your data models and configure them in a single location (not unlike the Django admin interface). This allows you to easily manage the way your models are displayed and interacted with in the FairDM interface.
