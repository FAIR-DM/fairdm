# Developer Guide

This guide is designed for developers who want to build and deploy a new FairDM portal. While you don’t need to be a Django or Docker expert, you should have a working knowledge of Python and general web development concepts.

We’ll walk you through the entire process—from setting up your development environment to launching your portal in the cloud.
