# Contributor Guide

**For portal contributors** who add and edit research data in FairDM portals.

```{note}
This guide is for people who contribute data and metadata to an existing FairDM portal. If you want to contribute to the FairDM framework itself (code, documentation, examples), see the [Contributing Guide](../contributing/index.md) for framework contributors.
```

## Your Role

As a portal contributor, you will:

- **Access and browse research data**: Search and view projects, datasets, samples, and measurements
- **Contribute data**: Add and edit research data entries in the portal
- **Follow FAIR practices**: Understand and provide required metadata to ensure data quality and reusability
- **Manage your account**: Configure your profile and authentication settings

## Why FAIR Metadata Matters

FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ensure that research data remains valuable beyond the immediate project. When you contribute data:

- **Findable**: Proper metadata helps others discover your data via search engines and data repositories
- **Accessible**: Clear descriptions and persistent identifiers make it easy to retrieve and cite data
- **Interoperable**: Standardized fields allow data to be combined with other datasets
- **Reusable**: Well-documented data enables future research and verification

Your role as a contributor is essential: accurate, complete metadata entry directly improves the quality and impact of the research.

## What You'll Find Here

This guide helps you:

- Create and manage your account
- Understand the core data structures (Projects, Datasets, Samples, Measurements)
- Learn how to add and edit data while following FAIR metadata practices
- Navigate the portal effectively
