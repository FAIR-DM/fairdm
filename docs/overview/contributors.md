# Contributors

FairDM treats contributor attribution and provenance as first-class concerns. This supports FAIR-aligned reuse (clear provenance and contact points) and helps research communities give credit for the work involved in collecting, processing, curating, and publishing data.

## What FairDM means by “contributor”

FairDM documentation uses two related terms:

- **Portal users**: people and organizations who contribute to the *research outputs* managed in a FairDM portal (projects, datasets, samples, measurements, metadata, and curation activities).
- **Framework contributors**: people who contribute to the *FairDM framework itself* (code, documentation, tests, releases).

This page focuses on **portal users**.

## Why record contributors?

Recording contributor information is important for both practical and ethical reasons:

- **Provenance and reuse**: users need to understand who created, collected, processed, or curated data to assess fitness-for-purpose and to contact the right person.
- **Recognition**: contributor records make invisible work (e.g., data management, curation, field collection) visible and attributable.
- **Governance and accountability**: teams can track who did what, when, and in what role, supporting internal auditing and compliance.

## Where contributors appear

In a typical FairDM portal, contributor information can be shown on:

- **Project pages**: the people and organizations involved in the project and their roles.
- **Dataset pages**: who created, curated, and maintains the dataset.
- **Sample pages**: who collected and processed a sample.
- **Measurement pages**: who performed, validated, or reviewed a measurement.

Exact roles and required fields can vary by portal configuration.

## Identifiers and profiles

Where available, contributor records can be linked to persistent identifiers and profiles, such as:

- **ORCID iDs** for individuals
- **ROR IDs** for organizations
