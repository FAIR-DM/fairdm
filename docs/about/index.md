# About

FairDM is an open-source Django-based framework for building FAIR-aligned research data portals. This section provides essential context for understanding FairDM's vision, philosophy, and architecture.

## FairDM Constitution

The [FairDM Constitution](https://github.com/FAIR-DM/fairdm/blob/main/.specify/memory/constitution.md) defines the project's core principles, architecture constraints, development workflow, and governance model. It serves as the foundation for all design decisions and contributions to the framework.

Key principles include:

- **FAIR-First**: Every feature must support or at minimum not weaken FAIR characteristics
- **Domain-Driven, Declarative Modeling**: Stable core models with declarative extensions
- **Configuration Over Custom Plumbing**: Registration and configuration, not boilerplate
- **Opinionated, Production-Grade Defaults**: Modern Django stack with sensible defaults
- **Quality, Sustainability, and Community**: Tests, documentation, and clear contribution guidelines
