# Core Features of FairDM

FairDM offers a comprehensive, flexible platform designed to support all aspects of research data management—combining robust data modeling with rich community and collaboration features.

## Structured Core Data Model

At its foundation, FairDM organizes data into four interconnected levels—**Project, Dataset, Sample,** and **Measurement**—capturing essential metadata common across research domains. This core model provides a consistent framework while allowing domain-specific customization. *(A detailed overview of the data model follows below.)*

## Community Engagement and Collaboration

FairDM encourages active participation and collaboration among researchers through:

- **Personal accounts and profiles:** Users can create personal accounts to manage their projects and datasets, log in via ORCID to sync their data, and showcase their work through customizable profiles.
- **Contribution tracking:** FairDM tracks individual contributions across datasets and projects, helping users build a clear record of their research involvement.
- **Following and updates:** Users can follow other researchers and projects to stay informed about new developments and progress.
- **Comments and discussions:** Community members can engage by commenting on datasets and projects, fostering dialogue and collaboration.
- **Sharing and visibility:** Researchers can share their datasets and projects publicly to encourage knowledge exchange and collaborative opportunities.

## Project and Dataset Management

FairDM supports comprehensive management of research projects and datasets:

- Create, share, and manage research projects, giving visibility to ongoing, past, and future work.
- Upload and publish datasets that conform to predefined metadata standards.
- Manage contributors—both personal and organizational—to ensure proper attribution.
- Publish datasets with support for external services (e.g., GFZ Data Services).
- Even datasets in development can be added early to track progress, organize metadata, and attract collaboration.

## User-Friendly Data Access

Researchers and community members can explore and interact with data via a clean, intuitive interface:

- Search and filter datasets and projects using powerful list views and filtering tools.
- Access “data collections” that aggregate specific types of samples or measurements across multiple datasets.
- View detailed pages for individual projects, datasets, sites, and measurements.
- Download data in common formats, supporting further analysis or reuse.

## Programmatic Access

FairDM includes a fully documented RESTful API to facilitate:

- Automated data harvesting.
- Integration into existing research workflows and software.
- Programmatic querying and data retrieval for advanced applications.

## Authentication and Access Control

- ORCID and third-party login integration for seamless authentication.
- Email verification and optional two-factor authentication.
- Role-based access control supporting public and private dataset visibility.
- Account and profile management tailored to community needs.

## Administrative Tools

- Intuitive administration interface for managing portal content, contributors, and metadata.
- Flexible schema extension to adapt to specific domain requirements.
- Role management for contributors, moderators, and editors.
- Clear separation of data and presentation layers for easy customization.
- Deployment support through Docker Compose templates suited to varied hosting environments, including cloud-based object storage.

## Standards and Interoperability

- Native integration with research data identifiers and standards such as ORCID, IGSN, and DataCite.
- Use of controlled vocabularies to improve data consistency and interoperability.
- Persistent identifiers for datasets and samples to support long-term citation and tracking.
- Export-ready metadata and data formats for easy sharing with external repositories.

## Modularity and Customization

FairDM’s modular design allows enabling or disabling features as needed (e.g., account creation, discussion forums), providing portals that fit the unique requirements of different research communities.

## Documentation and Support

FairDM places a strong emphasis on comprehensive documentation and community support to ensure users and developers can get the most out of the framework.

- **User Guide:** Clear, step-by-step instructions help researchers and data managers understand how to navigate the portal, manage datasets, and engage with community features.
- **Administrator Guide:** Detailed resources assist portal administrators in configuring the system, managing users and permissions, and maintaining the platform efficiently.
- **Developer Guide:** For developers extending or customizing FairDM, thorough technical documentation covers the data model, API usage, extension points, and deployment best practices.
- **Community and Collaboration:** FairDM encourages an active user and developer community, offering forums, issue trackers, and contribution guidelines to foster collaboration, feedback, and continuous improvement.
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Regular updates and a clear roadmap ensure that FairDM evolves with emerging research data standards and technology trends, backed by responsive support channels.
